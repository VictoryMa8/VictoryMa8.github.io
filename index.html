        <h1>Are there potential risks in the applications we use everyday?</h1>
        <p class="pClass">The purposes of this website is to inform the public of the various ways social media and mobile game applications can have negative affects on a person's mental and physical and wellbeing. Several studies have indicated that these applications and mobile devices are able to harm the mental development in children. As the world continues to become more and more reliant on technology and devices, it is paramount for society to become more literate in the concepts and algorithms that influence their everyday lives.</p>

        <p class="pClass">We have created various pages for the certain demographics who interact with smartphones on a daily basis. Our goal is to inform everyone in an effective and unbiased manner. It is therefore important to take notice of the navigation bar, and decide which demographic suits you the best.</p>
        
        <p class="pClass">Parents and guardians should be able to understand what their children could be consuming with their mobile devices. They should also know various ways they could help their child reduce the chance of device overuse.</p>

        <p class="pClass">Children and teenagers themselves should also understand the risks that are involved when they obtain their first phone. They should be able to know the applications or games that may contain malpractices, such as addicting social media designs or predatory pay-to-win games.</p>
        <p class="pClass">Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, the developers and designers of the applications that are found on devices should understand the various ways their algorithms and applications can negatively affect the average person. Our goal is to provide information, data, and statistics to shed light on the possible harmful effects of the applications that we use on a daily basis.</p>
