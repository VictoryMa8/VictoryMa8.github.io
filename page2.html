        <h1>Parents & Guardians: What You Need To Know</h1>
        <hr>
        <p class="pClass">It is important to know what goes into the apps that you and your children use everyday. The algorithms and designs that go into mobile applications are often unexplained to the average user. Various unexplained parts of apps can include how content is chosen to be shown to the user, how endlessly scrolling works, and how free mobile games make their money. Not all practices in the industry are predatory or harmful, but there may be a few that you should look out for. When interacting with a new app, a person who does not have an extensive background in software design should be able to recognize certain practices or algorithms in order to make the best decision going forward in using said app. Our goal is to showcase the data and statistics on phone usage, as well as the design elements that are potential risks to you and your family. </p>

        <p>According to the <a class="aClass" target="_blank" href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/infinite-scrolling#:~:text=Infinite%20scrolling%20is%20an%20interaction,definite%20structure%20or%20sorting%20order.">Interaction Design Foundation</a>, infinite scrolling is defined as "an interaction design pattern in which a page loads content as the user scrolls down, allowing the user to explore a large amount of content with no distinct end"</p>

        <p>Furthermore, they state that While infinite scrolling increases time spent on sites, it is also responsible for creating addictive experiences. After public outcry on the addictive design practices of social media applications, Instagram and YouTube have implemented settings to limit users' time on the application</p>
        <p>According to <a class="aClass" target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6679162/">Christian Montag et al.,</a> Excessive use of smartphones is known to impact on social communication in terms of reducing smiles when interacting with strangers, enjoyment of face-to-face interaction or drawing parent's attention away from their children. This might result in a loss of empathy, although so far only correlations between excessive Internet use and lower empathy/social skills could be established, with only weak associations between excessive smartphone usage and empathy.</p>
        <p>As reported by <a class="aClass" target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6679162/">Christian Montag et al.,</a> 'Freemium', is a hybrid of the English words 'free' and 'premium'. In the realm of Freemium games, this means that the basic version of a game can be downloaded at no monetary cost. However, the person playing a game pays either with his/her data produced while playing, by paying attention to ads, e.g., in exchange for further game-energy, or by paying money to access 'premium' content. Freemium games are very relevant for the present work investigating elements of apps built to prolong usage time, because such games most often run with the business model of 'gaming service in exchange for your data'.</p>
        <p>Highlighted by <a class="aClass" target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6679162/">Christian Montag et al.,</a> Perhaps one of the most prominent features of social reward mechanisms in social media is the iconic 'thumbs up' (giving or getting a 'Like'; (co-)developed by Justin Rosenstein, former worker at Facebook; see also independent.co.uk). Likes demonstrate either positive social feedback on one's own posts or to give another person such a feedback. The power of such feedback has also been proven neuroscientifically, when Instagram users are confronted with their own posted pictures from their account which were manipulated by being presented either with many or few 'Likes' (in this case hearts). Pictures being presented with many Likes elicit stronger activity in the ventral striatum, an area involved of the processing of a rewards. It has even been demonstrated that lower gray matter volumes of the nucleus accumbens are associated with longer and higher frequent usage of the Facebook app on smartphones underlining its addictive power. Additionally, several other studies observed that lower gray matter volumes were associated with higher addictive tendencies.</p>
