        <h1>Children & Teenagers: Social Media and Game Addiction</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Have you ever felt as if your electronic usage such as social media and gaming was negatively effecting your life? Studies show that this is not something that is just a farce, but there are genuine psychological impacts to having an addiction to video games and social media.</p>
        <p>According to a study conducted, video game addiction can lead to changes in the brain that are similar to brain activity of those addicted to substances and gambling. Other symptoms include social withdrawal, psychological withdrawal, and consequences coming from long gaming sessions.</p>
        <p>This could be especially rampant if you partake in microtransactions. These are small monetary transactions that could either allow you to purchase an in game currency to then purchase items that will help you advance. The danger in these microtransactions that often they are so small that you usually won't realize how much you are spending if you purchase in game currency often. Also with games that only allow you to purchase items with in game currency can be deceptive as well, since you don't know how much money you are spending exactly on an item. Unless you do the calculations, which most times people won't take the time to calculate the exact cost.</p>
        <p>These microtransactions will add up quite quickly, which responsible spending is an important skill to carry on from adolescence into adulthood. </p>

        <p>Social media is also another addictive application that decreases attention span due to the urge to check it while attempting to focus on other activities. One aspect of social media that is so addicting is the notifications, since often times these notifications trigger the release of a hormone called dopamine. This hormone is released and causes a positive association with whatever action caused it to be released. In this case it may be the notifications regarding the amount of likes you received on a post etc. This cycle can lead teens just like you to continue to seek this instant gratification from social media. </p>
        <p>Some ways you can combat this is developing some other hobbies you enjoy, such as going on nature walks, playing team sports, and exercising. You can also manage your screen time through the settings on your phone and also limiting notifications from social media apps. </p>
